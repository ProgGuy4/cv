    <h3>Work Experience Description</h3>
    <strong>UPS - InfoSec IT Intern</strong>
    <p>
        During my internship I learned more about firewalls and firewall rules. I
        also learned about Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and the unique benefits it
        offers compared to other cloud computing providers. I competed in a CTF
        using Microsoft Sentinel, which is a SIEM and SOAR platform. I learned
        how to do various actions in Sentinel, such as threat detection and
        response, and analyzing logs. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <strong>Trane Technologies - IT Epic Intern, Solutions Design</strong>
    <p>
        During my Internship I learned about Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) by
        working through multiple courses, and I sat in on meetings related to a big
        OCI project. At the end of my internship, I made a flow chart in Visio that
        showcases the sequential development of the project, and I presented it to
        my supervisor, manager, and other team members.
